# 🐧 Linux Basics: A Clear, Beginner-Friendly Introduction

---

## 🌱 1. What Linux Is
Linux is an open‑source operating system used in servers, cloud platforms, cybersecurity, DevOps, and embedded systems.

It’s built around the command line, which gives you precise control over the system.

**Popular distributions (distros):** Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Kali, Arch.

If you’re practicing on your laptop, **Ubuntu or Linux Mint** is the easiest starting point.

## 📁 2. The Linux Filesystem (Very Important)
Linux organizes everything into a single tree starting at `/` (root).

| Directory | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/home` | Personal files for each user |
| `/etc` | System configuration files |
| `/var` | Logs, caches, variable data |
| `/usr` | Applications and libraries |
| `/bin` | Essential user commands |
| `/sbin` | System administration commands |
| `/root` | Home directory for the root user |

You’ll use `/home/<username>` most of the time.

## 🧭 3. Basic Navigation Commands
These are the first commands every Linux user learns.

| Action | Command | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Show current directory | `pwd` | “Where am I?” |
| List files | `ls` | Show files and folders |
| List with details | `ls -l` | Permissions, size, owner |
| List hidden files | `ls -a` | Shows files starting with `.` |
| Change directory | `cd foldername` | Move into a folder |
| Go back one level | `cd ..` | Up one directory |
| Go to home | `cd` | Shortcut |

Try these slowly and observe how the terminal responds.

## 📄 4. Working With Files and Folders

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Create a folder | `mkdir myfolder` |
| Create a file | `touch file.txt` |
| Copy a file | `cp file.txt backup.txt` |
| Move/rename | `mv old.txt new.txt` |
| Delete a file | `rm file.txt` |
| Delete a folder | `rm -r foldername` |

⚠️ **Be careful with `rm -r` — it deletes permanently.**

---

## 🔐 5. Permissions (The Part Beginners Struggle With)
Every file has:

- **Owner**
- **Group**
- **Permissions:** read (r), write (w), execute (x)

Example from `ls -l`:

```
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 4096 Jan 26 script.sh
```

**Breakdown:**

- `rwx` → owner can read/write/execute  
- `r-x` → group can read/execute  
- `r--` → others can only read  

**Change permissions:**

```
chmod 755 script.sh
```

**Change owner:**

```
sudo chown user:group file
```

## 🧰 6. Installing Software
Depends on the distro.

### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install package-name
```

### On Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install package-name
```

---

## 🧪 7. Viewing and Editing Files

### View content:
```
cat file.txt
less file.txt
head file.txt
tail file.txt
```

### Edit content:
- `nano file.txt` (beginner-friendly)  
- `vim file.txt` (powerful but steep learning curve)

---

## 🧩 8. Processes and System Monitoring

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Show running processes | `ps aux` |
| Kill a process | `kill <PID>` |
| Live system monitor | `top` or `htop` |

---

## 🔑 9. Using sudo
`sudo` = “run as administrator”.

Example:

```
sudo apt update
```

You’ll be asked for your password.  
Use it only when necessary.

---

## 🌐 10. Networking Basics

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Show IP address | `ip a` |
| Test connection | `ping google.com` |
| Show open ports | `ss -tulnp` |
